\section{Introduction}
This document outlines the software requirements for Carbon Charts. The purpose of this document is to specify requirements and provide a complete description of the library to be developed. It will outline the intended purpose, features of the library, behavior, and general factors that affect the library and its requirements. Additionally, it will illustrate the constraints under which the library must operate and conform to. This document will serve as a complete declaration of the data visualization library in development and is intended for stakeholders and application developers. The audience includes the stakeholders, Dr. Wassyng, Nicholas Annable, Joshua Barkovic, Spencer Deevy, Viktor Smirnov and any potential developers. 


%//FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEFINE HARDWARE ASAP  
%In addition, it outlines the hardware requirements relating to acquiring the real-time sensory data that will be displayed by the charts.

\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{Background of the Project Effort}
The information age had led to a rapid increase in the amount of raw data available. This increase in raw data is only beneficial when we use methods to derive insights from it. Humans are visual creatures, detecting patterns in sets of data is more easily interpreted using data visualization techniques. A common and convenient mode of consuming visualized data is through graphical charts. The process of mapping information to visuals is more efficient and accurate when employing the power of computing. The increased speed enables the use of much larger data sets while allowing for quick re-rending of alternative mappings.



%//FIX THIS 
%The capabilities of the library will be visualized by charting real-time sensory data, such as temperature, pressure, proximity etc.

\subsection{Scope}
Carbon Charts is an open-source JavaScript data visualization library that will be used as a functional component of IBM's Carbon Design System. The library is expected to comply with the general IBM design guidelines with the intended goal of making any data visualization processes within their products more efficient while eliminating duplicated work within different teams. It will be used to extend the data visualization capabilities of IBM Carbon Design system by serving as an interactive, lightweight charting library. Additionally, it should be designed in accordance with design principles that follow its open source nature. 

\subsubsection{Benefits}
The proposed library merits the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reuseability: The Carbon Charts library will allow for the use of its existing (stable and verified) visualization techniques within the software development process of other internal IBM products,  
    \item Extensibility: As an open-source project, the library is easily extensible and provides for change while minimizing the impact to existing system functions. Low cohesion and high coupling allow for continual development with-in the open-source community.
    
    %--> Design principle that we can use for the design doc, so leave reference here.
    %\item Liskov's Substitution Principle: Every chart in the Carbon Charts Library inherently derived from a base chart class.  \item Separation of Concerns: Carbon Charts separates the logic of content presentation style and that of how the content interacts and behaves with the user. 
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{IBM Canada Ltd}
\begin{itemize}

%//Note: we should define distruptive innovation just incase 
    \item IBM Canada is generally interested in disruptions within the open-source community, they invest significant amounts of effort and funds into creating an inspirational footprint within the community.
   
 %//Note:  (reference stole it from carbon design system facts)
    \item Carbon the new IBM Design Language will define and guide everything designed by IBM, including software products, digital and traditional marketing, hardware, advertising. and more. 
    
    
    %\item The library is expected to comply with the general IBM design guidelines with the intended goal of making any data visualization processes within their products more efficient while eliminating duplicated work within different teams.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Application Developers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Web application developers can use the library to create interactive visualizations of data they would like to present to their users.  
    \item Generally, developers would be looking for a solution that is lightweight, high-performance, reliable and accurate in results. Depending on what organization or project they are involved in, they might also have accessibility and internationalization requirements.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Application Users}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users of web applications represent the target audience of this library. They can use charts generated by the developer and through the library, to monitor data (sensitive data in many cases), analyze patterns between data sets, make decisions based on historic representations and values, all while being able to take advantage of real-time visualizations in some cases (e.g. trading).
    \item Users will generally be looking for reliable functionality, an appealing visual representation and accessibility.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Axis Chart:} Axis charts display data between a set of axis. Axis charts are 2 or 3 dimensional, with at least an x and y axis.
    \item \textbf{Non-Axis Chart:} Axis charts display data within an area not defined by axis. (e.g. Pie Charts).
    \item \textbf{Right-to-Left Support:} The ability to display languages that read right to left, such as Farsi.
    \item \textbf{Browser Tiers:} We define two tiers of browsers A and B. Tier A browsers consist of the two latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari at any time, and any versions below those including IE-11+ will be part of tier B.
    \item \textbf{Test Data:} A set of example data. This set will initially consist of a random sampling of all valid data within the expected range, but will be extended to any particular data that cause issues in the software as it develops. Requirements that involve the test data in their fit criterion will be considered unmet if any member of the test data fail that requirement.
    \item \textbf{Demonstration Environment:} An environment resembling a common household room; no extreme conditions (temperature, pressure, magnetic fields, impact forces etc).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}
\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Must adhere to IBM open source guideline (eg. code styling, structure).
    \item Must operate as a component within IBM's Carbon Design System.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Milestone deadlines for McMaster Capstone project.
    \item Release deadlines for external IBM projects that rely on stable versions of Carbon Charts. These deadlines may be announced at any time in the future.
    \item Due to team members having other obligations, the project is limited to 10 hours per week. Team members may opt to exceed this limit, but it is not required.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \$750 CAD is the budget constraint imposed on us by the assigment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Off-The-Shelf Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item d3.js is a widely used JavaScript library for data visualization. Initially released in 2011, it has gone through many levels of user testing, bug discoveries and refactors, and has iterated to become an industry standard for web visualizations. The library offers some core functionality to be able to select and manipulate SVG elements, implement quick and easy progressive web transitions, perform data-binding on DOM elements etc.
    \item Chart.js is an open source JavaScript charting library for designers and developers.
    \item Chartist.js an open source JavaScript charting library. It is the product of a community that was disappointed about the abilities provided by other charting libraries.
    \item (Hardware) Arduino is an open-source electronic prototyping platform enabling users to create interactive electronic objects. It can be used to interface with various sensors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsubsection{Facts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data representations are often only defined for specific data types. For example, it is obvious that charts with numeric axis can only accept numerical values on that axis. It will always be assumed that any such invalid data is not present.
    \item Data sets in general is unbounded in size and can have any number of elements. We will assume an "expected data range" of 0 to 50 data points. Data sets larger than this cannot be usefully displayed in a visual graph due to screen space limitations, so we have decided to exclude them.
    \item The hardware will only be expected to operate in the demonstration environment.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is assumed that developers will use library functions correctly, and pass in the correct data types within the correct data range.
\end{itemize}
